## TOOLS USED

Utilized Power Query to extract and transform the data, then transferred the data to Power Pivot for further analysis.
Power Pivot is used to store the data for further exploration in the future, if the number of rows increases into the millions.
Implemented DISTINCTCOUNT and COUNT and SUM functions to prepare reports that interpret total bill, order,revenue, profit on a monthly and Weekdays basis.
